## Summary

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
This is the first of five assigned projects on The Odin Project Foundations course! In this assignment I learned how to create HTML boilerplate, created directory from the command terminal and vs code. In this basic HTML assignment, I created paragraphs, links, images and unordered lists for my recipes.
